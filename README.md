# Fayette County AI Search

A modern, responsive search interface that provides intelligent search results for Fayette County government services. The application features real-time search with debounced API calls, keyboard navigation, and a clean, accessible user interface with a magnifying glass icon.

## Features

- 🔍 **Real-time Search**: As-you-type search with 1-second debouncing
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys to navigate results, Enter to select, Escape to close
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- ♿ **Accessibility**: Full keyboard support and screen reader friendly
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, dark theme with smooth animations and search icon
- 🔗 **External Links**: Results open in new tabs for seamless browsing

## How It Works

1. **Input Handling**: The search input captures user queries with real-time filtering
2. **API Integration**: Queries are sent to `temp.json` (simulating an API endpoint)
3. **Result Filtering**: Results are filtered client-side based on query matching
4. **Display**: Results show phrase, subtext, and URL with clickable links
